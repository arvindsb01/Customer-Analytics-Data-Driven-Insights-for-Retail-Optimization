# Data Analytics & Commercial Insights Simulation â€“ Quantium

This repository contains the work I completed during a **Data Analytics & Commercial Insights Simulation** as part of the **Quantium Data Science Team**. The project focused on analyzing **transaction datasets** to derive actionable insights and deliver data-driven recommendations for retail strategy and optimization.

## Project Overview

In this simulation, I:

- Analyzed transaction datasets to extract valuable insights on customer behavior.
- Conducted **uplift testing** on trial store layouts to assess their impact on sales and performance.
- Identified **benchmark stores** for testing and provided **evidence-based recommendations** to improve store layout strategies.
- Created comprehensive reports for the **Category Manager**, which facilitated informed commercial decisions.
- Leveraged **data visualization** techniques to present findings in an accessible format for key stakeholders.

## Key Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis, statistical modeling, and automation of tasks.
- **SQL**: For querying transactional databases to retrieve relevant data.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For organizing data and performing initial analysis.
- **Power BI**: For visualizing key insights and creating interactive reports.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For documenting and presenting the analysis workflow.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Prepared transactional data for analysis, including handling missing values and outliers.
- **Customer Analytics**: Analyzed customer purchasing behavior to identify key patterns and trends.
- **Uplift Testing**: Conducted tests to determine the effectiveness of different store layouts on sales.
- **Benchmark Store Identification**: Selected benchmark stores to serve as control variables for testing.
- **Reports & Insights**: Delivered actionable insights through detailed reports and visualizations for strategic decision-making.

## Project Goals

- Gain hands-on experience in analyzing customer data and providing actionable business recommendations.
- Learn how to effectively use data to influence commercial strategies and decision-making.
- Develop expertise in retail analytics and optimization, particularly in store layout and performance analysis.

## Getting Started
